# Roadmap

Planned features for GitHub Repo Analyzer.

## High Value

- [ ] **Branch/tag selector** - Analyze specific branches or tags, not just default branch
- [ ] **Search/filter files** - Search by filename or extension in the tree
- [ ] **File size stats** - Show total size, largest files, size by extension
- [ ] **Copy tree as text** - Export file tree as ASCII/markdown for documentation
- [ ] **Share via URL** - Encode repo in URL params for easy sharing (e.g., `?repo=facebook/react`)

## Visual Enhancements

- [ ] **Pie/donut chart** - Visual breakdown of file types
- [ ] **Treemap visualization** - Size-based visual representation
- [ ] **Lines of code estimate** - Rough LOC count by language

## Comparison & History

- [ ] **Compare two repos** - Side-by-side structure comparison
- [ ] **Compare branches** - Diff file structure between branches

## Export & Integration

- [ ] **Download as JSON** - Export analysis data
- [ ] **Generate README badge** - File count badge for repos
- [ ] **GitHub OAuth** - Access private repos (optional)

## Performance

- [ ] **Caching** - Cache results in localStorage
- [ ] **Pagination for large repos** - Handle truncated trees better
